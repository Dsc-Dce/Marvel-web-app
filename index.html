            <p>
                The shared storytelling palette known as the Marvel universe was unveiled in 1961, when Goodman responded to the growing interest in superhero books by commissioning writer <span>Stan Lee</span> and artist <span>Kirby</span>  to create the Fantastic Four. 
                <br><br>
                With the release of Fantastic Four no. 1 (November 1961), readers were introduced to a superheroic setting that was, nevertheless, rooted in the real world. Lee and Kirby attempted to make their comic book characters more original by allowing them to interact with each other in a realistic fashion, including heroes often fighting or arguing with each other. 
                <br><br>
                This trend continued with a flood of other superhero characters introduced by Marvel Comics during the early 1960s, including <span>Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk, and the X-Men</span>. Lee wrote the majority of Marvelâ€™s books during that time, and <span>Jack Kirby</span> and <span>Steve Ditko</span> were the most important and influential artists.

            <h1>Google Developer Student Club</h1>
            <p>
                <span>Google Developer Student Clubs</span> are community groups for college and university students interested in Google developer technologies. 
                <br><br>
                Students from all undergraduate or graduate programs with an interest in growing as a developer are welcome. By joining a GDSC, students grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and their community. 
                <br><br>
                One of our goals is to bridge the gap between theory and practical application for student developers.
                <br><br>
                <span>Developer Student Clubs is the first and only technical community at Dronacharya College Of Engineering</span>, and it is helping numerous students to bridge the gap between theory and practice by connecting them with relevant opportunities, so that they can grow their knowledge and build effective solutions.
