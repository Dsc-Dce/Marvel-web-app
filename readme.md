# About the PROJECT #

None of us can deny the fact that we, the Gen-Z, got to know DC before Marvel ( A die-hard DC fan talking lol). I mean come on, it was just like a clone of DC for many years until it came out as The Marvel Universe which all of us are crazy about. 

Nobody can deny the fact that how much these superheroes comically give their lives to save Americans, we can never get enough of it!
(Tell me how many tears you shed after endgame and I'll tell mine.)
Blackwidow as the coolest feminine figure, Iron Man and his fatherly love towards Spidy, Captain's abs, not gonna leave Deadpool behind and our handsomest Hulk;
how perfectly these Avengers become our escape from reality that we all need. 

Keeping all that in our dearest minds let's create a clone website similar to Marvel's with your very creative minds using Open Source libraries with the instructions provided. 

Let's go and make Stan Lee proud!!!
